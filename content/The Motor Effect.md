# The Motor Effect

> When a current is passed through a conductor that is in a magnetic field, the conductor experiences a thrust or force.

The current produces its own magnetic field which acts against the field of the "permanent" magnet.

## Fleming's left-hand motor rule

- Forefinger points in direction of the FIELD.
- Second finger point in direction of the conventional CURRENT.
- Thumb points in direction of the FORCE.

## How does an electric motor work

- Commutator/Split ring
    - Reverse the direction of current through the coil so that the direction remains the same relative to the permanent magnetic field. 
    - Keeps coil turning in the same direction.
