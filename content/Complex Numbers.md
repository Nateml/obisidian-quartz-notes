# Complex Numbers

#### Standard-form

$a + bi$

- $a$ is the real part, while $b$ is imaginary part(see [Imaginary Numbers](Imaginary%20Numbers.md)).

Imaginary part is the coefficient of $i$.

**Can be treated as a "single number" containing two parts**

### Examples

> $$z = 5 + 3i$$
> $$\begin{align}
 Re(Z) &= 5 \\
 Im(Z) &= 3 
 \end{align}$$

Above cannot be simplified further.

Conjugate of above:

> $$\overline{z} = a - bi$$

> $$z + \overline{z} = 2Re(z)$$

## Simplifying expressions with complex numbers

1. [Imaginary Numbers](Imaginary%20Numbers.md)
2. Simplify real parts.
3. Put in [standard form](Complex%20Numbers.md#Standard-form)

## Solving equations with complex numbers

Since real and imaginary cannot interact with one another:

1. Equate real parts.
2. Equate imaginary parts.
3. Solve for each.

### Using conjugates to solve division

Multiply both the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator.

$$\begin{align}
\frac{1+2i}{4-5i} \times \frac{4+5i}{4+5i} &= \frac{4+5i+8i+10i^{2}}{4^{2}-(5i)^{2}} \textrm{ (denominator has diff of two squares)}\\
&= \frac{-6+13i}{16-(-25)} \\
&= \frac{-6+3i}{41} \\
&= \frac{-6}{41} + \frac{3}{41}i \textrm{ (Put in standard complex number form)}
\end{align}$$

## Absolute values of complex numbers
See [Absolute Values](Absolute%20Values.md).

$$\begin{align}
|3-4i| \\ \\
3^{2}+ 4^{2} &= |3-4i|^{2}\\
25 &= |3-4i|^{2}\\
5 &= |3-4i|
\end{align}$$

Above can be visualized using a Cartesian plane.
