# Polynomial Long Division
1. Divide first term of numerator by first term of denominator. Write as first term of answer.
2. Multiply the denominator by the above answer and write it below the numerator.
3. Subtract the above answer from the numerator and write down the new polynomial.
4. Repeat using the new polynomial.

The remainder is whatever is left over after dividing. Write this as a term divided by denominator and express it as being added to the quotient.
