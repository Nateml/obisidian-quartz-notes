# Derivatives
Gives the function $f(x)$ of the slope (gradient) of another function $g(x)$.

$$\begin{align}
f'(x) = \lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}
\end{align}$$

The above is comparable to the equation $m = \frac{\delta y}{\delta x}$. The fraction finds the gradient between two points on the function's graph. Instead of passing in concrete values, a generalization is made by using the variable $h$.
