# Maths & Science MOC

The home for everything maths and science related. 

Maths and science can be heavily related, especially when considering sciences like physics or computer science. This MOC acts as a resource hub for everything related to this avenue of thinking.

**Some disciplines to be included in this MOC**:
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Computer Science
- Engineering

If you're not sure if something should be placed here. Think:
1. Do I see lots of maths (latex)?
2. Is the concept often used in the above disciplines.
