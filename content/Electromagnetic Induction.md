# Electromagnetic Induction

Inverse of [The Motor Effect](The%20Motor%20Effect.md).

A magnetic field produces a current.

> When a wire is moves across a magnetic field, a small voltage is induced in the wire.

Current & voltage can be increased by:
- moving the wire faster
- using a stronger magnet
- increasing the length of the wire in the magnetic field (many loops of wire)

## Faraday's law of electromagnetic Induction

> If $B$ represents the magnetic flux density and $A$ represents the area of the loop, then the magnetic flux passing through the coils is equal to the product of $B$ and $A$ multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the normal to the loop and the magnetic field.
> $$\phi=BAcos(\theta)$$

Important symbols:

$B$ - magnetic flux density
$A$ - area of the loop (wire)
$\theta$ - angle between the normal to the loop and the magnetic field 
$\phi$ - magnetic flux passing through the coils
$N\phi$ - magnetic flux linkage ($N$ = number of turns)

Explained:

magnetic flux - a measurement of the total magnetic field which passes through a given area
magnetic flux density - the number of lines force passing through a unit area of material

> The EMF induced in a conductor is proportional to the rate at which magnetic field lines are cut by the conductor.

$$emf = -\frac{\delta N\phi}{\delta t}=-N\frac{\delta\phi}{\delta t}$$

Remember that field lines represent the strength of the magnetic field. More field lines = stronger magnetic field.

## Fleming's right hand dynamo rule

- Forefinger point to the FIELD
- Second finger points to conventional CURRENT
- Thumb points to THRUST

**NB** - max currents are obtained when the conductor moves at right angles through the magnetic field // no current can flow if the conductor moves in a parallel direction to the magnetic field.

Current & voltage can be increased by:
- moving the magnet faster 
    - decreases time variable and thus increases rate of magnetic flux
    - if magnet is still then no field lines are cut and thus no emf induced
- using a stronger magnet
    - increase $B$ magnetic flux density and thus increases rate of magnetic flux
- increasing the number of turns on the coil
    - increases the length of the wire cutting through the magnetic field
    - increase magnetic flux and emf is proportional to rate of magnetic     
    
Direction of movement of the magnet indicates whether emf is positive or negative.
    - Back and forth motion produces [Alternating Current](Alternating%20Current.md)
    
Pole of the magnet affects direction of emf.

## Lenz's law

> An induced current always flows in a direction such that it opposes the change which produced it.

Induced N pole repels N pole of magnet when moves towards one another. When moved away from one another, induced pole attract pole of magnet. This lets you predict the direction of the flow of current in the wire. Simply let the magnet be the point of reference and use the relative motion of the wire in [Fleming's right hand dynamo rule](#Fleming's%20right%20hand%20dynamo%20rule) to get direction of current.
