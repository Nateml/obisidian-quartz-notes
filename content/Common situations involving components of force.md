# Common situations involving components of force

This note should contain some helpful cases where one needs to calculate/use components of a force vector. 

## Components of gravity acting on an object on a slope

Note that the components above correspond to the axis specified on the left.
In this diagram, the normal is acting in the positive direction. **Ignore the positive and negative directions when only asked to give the magnitude of the components. **

The above can also be visualised by the following diagram.
